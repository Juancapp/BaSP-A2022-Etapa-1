### Week 01
``` 
Description:
    - This is the HTML document that I've done. The propose of this stage is only build the markup of the web page. It contains all the HTMl elements and sections that we need to use to make the web page future. I used the figma desktop landing page that we've worked last week as a reference. It only contains the main page. 
    
    - The page sections are: 
        - Aside: contains the sidebar
        - Header: contains page info, contact and introduction about the app
        - Main:
            - Reason Section: contains the reasons that explain the advantages of using the app 
            - Functions Section: contains app functions 
            - Form Section: contains a form to get info of page and company
            - History Section: contains a small text about the history of the company and info about this. 
            - Lists Section: contains three list which to access all the page sections   
        - Footer: contains contact info and name of the company. 

    - The main folder ("Semana-01") contains a index.html file and a folder called "assets" which has img files inside. The propose of this week is to prepare everything to add styles next week. 

How to open: 
    1- Access to the folder "Semana-01"
    2- Open the file "index.html" on your browser

 ``` 

### Week 02
```
        - Adding styles to the first week page.
        - The CSS has been coded on 1440x900px resolution. Not responsive. 
        - On this week I've added all the style of main page called "style.css". This file is inside "css" folder. 
        - I've created a copy of the folder "Semana-01" called "Semana-02" witch contained a exact copy of the index.html but with the corresponding bugs fixes from last week. Also, I've modified some elements to SS implementation easier. 
        - I've added a reset.css to make the page more adaptative to different  browsers
        - Icon images of "assets" folder have been removed because I've replaced them by icons coming from https://fontawesome.com/.
        - I've priorized elements and ids selectors to to minimize the unnecessary use of classes. These have been used mainly to HTML components and very specific cases. 
        - I've edited the "Week 01" part of this document to expand on details about that week. 
        - The design is not responsive but is scalable for work on responsive design in the future. I'll try to change some things in the next few days when I look at the problem of Week 3. 
        
    How to open: 
        1- Access to the folder "Semana-02".
        2- Open the file "index.html" on your browser.
        3- Make sure your browser display options are set to 1440x900px resolution.
