### Week 02

- Description:
    - Adding styles to the first week page.
    - The CSS has been coded on 1440x900px resolution. Not responsive.
    - On this week I've added all the style of main page called "style.css". This file is inside "css" folder.
    - I've created a copy of the folder "Semana-01" called "Semana-02" witch contained a exact copy of the index.html but with the corresponding bugs fixes from last week. Also, I've modified some elements to CSS implementation easier.
    - I've added a reset.css to make the page more adaptative to different  browsers
    - Icon images of "assets" folder have been removed because I've replaced them by icons coming from https://fontawesome.com/.
    - I've priorized elements and ids selectors to to minimize the unnecessary use of classes. These have been used mainly to HTML components and very specific cases.
    - I've edited the "Week 01" part of this document to expand on details about that week.
    - The design is not responsive but is scalable for work on responsive design in the future. I'll try to change some things in the next few days when I look at the problem of Week 3.

    - 1 - Access to the folder "Semana-02".
    - 2 - Open the file "index.html" on your browser.
